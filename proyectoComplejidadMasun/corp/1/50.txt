Four years ago, dogs attack a goat. The goat almost dies. He recovers on a farm. A rooster befriends him. The farm owner says that the rooster visits the goat to get away from other roosters. The elderly goat takes weeks to get better. The rooster stays with him the whole time. A farm worker says that the rooster protects the goat. She thinks that the rooster helps the goat get better. He has a friend. She says that now the rooster is always with the goat. He sleeps with him. He rides on him. The friends are always together.
