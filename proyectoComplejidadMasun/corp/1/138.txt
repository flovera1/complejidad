The Cincinnati Zoo in the USA has three Malaysian tiger cubs. Their mother ignores them. The zookeepers must take care of the cubs. An Australian dog becomes their nanny. His job is to be a resident companion at the zoo. He cuddles the babies. He is nice to them. He lets the cubs move all over him. He stops them if they are too rough. The dog can help other baby animals, too.
