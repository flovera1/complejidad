A man from California has the longest tongue in the world. It measures 10.13 centimetres. That is almost four inches! His tongue can be useful. He can eat ice cream easily. When he meets someone new, they always want to see his tongue. He sticks his tounge out. This can be a little strange. The man says long tongues run in his family. His younger brother has a long tongue, too.
