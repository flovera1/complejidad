Twelve swimmers swim about 10 kilometres. They swim from California to Mexico. They want to support human rights. They want to show their solidarity with the world. One hundred schoolchildren meet them in Mexico. They cheer for them. The event organiser says that the swim is not a protest. She says that the swim is for human rights. It is to show that every life is important.
