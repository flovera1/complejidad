A 24-year-old student drives to the Grand Canyon. This is in the desert in Arizona, USA. She runs out of petrol. She cannot leave. She is there alone for five days. She has no mobile phone signal. She cannot call for help. She spells out 'HELP' with rocks. In the end, a helicopter sees her. She says that other helicopters fly by her. None of them stop. Only this one stops. She says that she cries when this helicopter lands by her. A paramedic comes up to her. He asks her if she needs help.
