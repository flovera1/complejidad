There is a beach in Ireland. In 1984, there is a storm. It takes away all of the sand. This is not good. Less tourists come to the area. This year, there is a tide. It brings a lot of sand to that beach. It brings the beach back! People hope that tourists will start to come again. They want the beach to get a Blue Flag.
