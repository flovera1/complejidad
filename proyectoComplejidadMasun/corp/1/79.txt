Here is some news from a Washington zoo. It is about little lions. They must pass a swimming test. People throw them into water, and the animals must swim. All four cats hold their heads above the water. Three of them swim. One cat does not want to swim. It gets out of the water quickly. Small cats must pass the test at the zoo. The test covers their ability to swim. Water must be no danger to these cats.
