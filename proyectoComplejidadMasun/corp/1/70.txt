There is a special flower in a botanic garden in Belgium. It is special for its bad smell. It does not stop visitors from sticking their noses into it. The flower does not often bloom outside Indonesia. It takes between three and ten years for the special flower to grow fully. The flower smells like old meat. The smell attracts insects. Its stinky red leaves are open for only two days.
