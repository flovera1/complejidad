Here is news from the Amazon rainforest. Some people come out of the forest. These are isolated people. They live only in their group. They do not talk with other people. Someone films the moment. These people wear loincloths. They have bows and arrows. Some other people talk to them. They give them bananas. The people from the rainforest take the bananas, but they are afraid.
