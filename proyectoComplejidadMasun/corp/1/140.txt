There is a special cat in London. It is a leopard. It is not a real animal. It is only a machine. It looks like a real animal. People are afraid when they see the leopard. A man makes this animal for two months. He says that on the street the cat does not move. It only moves its tail from one side to another. But when people go near it, it makes noises and moves its face. Leopards are in danger. People destroy their place of living. Leopards now live closer to people than before. This project wants to inform people about the problems of the big cats. It wants to make conflicts between people and big cats smaller.
