The Dubai Canvas Event is a 3D art festival. Twenty-five artists come to the festival. They are from different countries. The winner gets money. This is the first award in the world for 3D art. The artists work outside. They work on a busy street. This can be difficult. However, it has its perks, too. Artists can talk to people. People can tell them what they like or do not like. The festival's director says that she wants people to know about this kind of art. There are also four female artists in the festival.
