A balloon festival is taking place in Tunisia. This is the event's third year. There are 25 balloons and 90 people. They come from all over the world. One pilot talks about ballooning. He says that you can land anywhere. However, you must also drive to the balloon to put it in the car. This is not easy in the desert. A balloon crew member says that ballooning is safe. There is almost no danger.
