The state of Arkansas executed its first death row prisoner in over a decade. The prisoner was put on death row in 1992 for the murder of his neighbour, Deborah Reese. The spokesman of the governor spoke to the governor right after the execution. He was sombre and had a message to the media in the media room. He said that it is a serious night all across Arkansas and that this is a responsibility which he does not take lightly. It is one of the most sad things that he had to do. In the end, however, the right thing was done. More importantly, for the first time since 1993, there is justice for Deborah Reese's family.
