Police and protesters clashed in Caracas, Venezuela over the government of President Nicolas Maduro. Violent protests have been happening for a month as the people demand new elections. Police targeted the protesters with tear gas, and many took cover behind makeshift shields to protect themselves from the gas and from rubber bullets. Amid all of this, one protester stayed calm and played his violin.
