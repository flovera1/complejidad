After she ran out of petrol, Amber VanHecke survived alone at the Grand Canyon for five days. The 24-year-old had no mobile phone signal, so she used rocks to spell out 'HELP', which a person in a paramedic helicopter eventually spotted. That helicopter took her home. Over the five days, she said that other helicopters had flown by but had not seen her. When this helicopter came to land, she started to cry. The paramedic in the helicopter came out and asked her if she had called for help.
