Thousands in Moscow took to the streets in protest against corruption and demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Medvedev. People believe that the protest is the biggest anti-Kremlin protest since 2011. However, opinion polls suggest that Putin still has higher ratings than the liberal opposition. Police detained hundreds including Alexei Navalny, the opposition leader who called for the anti-corruption protests.
