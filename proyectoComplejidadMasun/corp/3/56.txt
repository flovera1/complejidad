A dashboard camera recorded the harrowing moment a four-year-old girl fell out of the back of a bus. The door of the church bus swung open and the young girl fell out onto the Arkansas state highway. A volunteer firefighter quickly rescued her, as he happened to be driving behind the bus. He would not normally move the girl, but he had to because of the busy traffic. The girl's family told reporters that they believe that she will make a full recovery.
