The Horniman Museum in London is hosting an exhibition that allows children to understand how the natural world works through robotic models of animals. The robotic platypus, for example, has large flashing red lights on its bill which represent the animal's electroreceptors, which pick up electrical pulses given off by anything alive. Visitors can also catch bugs, use bat sonar and interact with creatures normally only seen in textbooks. Velcro is used to demonstrate how a housefly can stay on the wall, and it sucks up its food like a vacuum cleaner.
