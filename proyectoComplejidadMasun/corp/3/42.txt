A bus driver in New Mexico was not wearing his seat belt when a pickup truck allegedly ran a red light, sending the driver through the windscreen. Miraculously, the bus driver only suffered cuts and grazes, and fortunately, there were no passengers onboard the bus. Both drivers went to hospital. The city transit department released the dramatic footage of the incident.
