The Hubble Space Telescope took an incredible image in 2009 of a galaxy being ripped apart. The galaxy was moving through a cluster of galaxies known as the Norma Cluster. The region where this occurred is around 200 million light years away from Earth. It takes scientists years to study the complex images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, which has been taking pictures of space since it launched in 1990.
