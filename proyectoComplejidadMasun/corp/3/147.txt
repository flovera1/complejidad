Eighty-seven-year-old Ursula Shepherd from the UK left school in 1944 without being able to read, and she never had time to learn to read because she had to look after her poorly parents. At school in the 1930s and 1940s, she had pretended to read by turning the page when her classmates did. Ursula felt that she had missed out and felt really sad seeing other people read the papers or a book and decided that it was time to finally learn to read. She is making progress and hopes that she can inspire other people to read, too.
