Fang Chunlin, a Chinese crane operator, amazed his colleagues as he used a machine to pick up an egg. He works at an oil field company; his day-to-day job is transporting pipes using a 24-tonne crane with a three tonne- grabber. He said the pipe cracking sounds are like 'a kind of music' which always makes him 'full of happiness' and feel a 'sense of accomplishment '.
