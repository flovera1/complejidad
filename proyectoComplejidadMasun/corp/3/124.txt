A network that listens for nuclear weapons detonations detected 26 major explosions on Earth between 2000 and 2013. Nuclear weapons caused none of them, but asteroid strikes caused all of them. California-based B612 Foundation released a visualisation of what it would look like if a city-destroying asteroid hit the planet Earth. The chance of an asteroid striking our planet is in fact higher than scientists previously believed. There is already a NASA program in place which tracks asteroids larger than 1 kilometre. An object of this size would have global consequences if it struck the Earth.
