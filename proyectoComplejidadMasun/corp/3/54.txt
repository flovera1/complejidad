Japan dispatched its largest warship, the helicopter carrier Izumo, since it passed laws expanding the role of its military. It is escorting a US supply vessel within Japanese waters. The US ship will refuel US vessels in the area, including the Carl Vinson aircraft carrier group sent to the Korean waters last week, in response to North Korea's failed missile test. North Korea has threatened to sink the carrier amid rising tensions in the region.
