Brazil's indigenous authority filmed the moment an isolated native people emerged from the Amazon rainforest and made contact with the outside world. The natives wore loincloths and carried bows and arrows. This happened along the banks of the Envira River, which is near the Peruvian border. The footage showed men from the Panoan linguistic group as they interacted with local villagers of northern Brazil. One of the villagers gave bananas to two of the natives, wary of approaching him, as they quickly grabbed the fruit and retreated out of arm's reach. Brazilian experts said that the indigenous people were likely crossing the border from Peru, as they were facing pressure from illegal logging and drug trafficking at their home.
