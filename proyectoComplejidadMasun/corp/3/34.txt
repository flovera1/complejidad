Twelve international swimmers swam almost 10 kilometres across the border of the US and Mexico to support human rights and to show their solidarity with the world. The athletes took the Pacific Ocean Route from Imperial Beach, California to Mexico. One hundred schoolchildren cheered the swimmers when they reached their destination. Kim Chambers, the event organiser, said that the swim was not a protest or a political statement, but it was 'a swim for human rights and to cast a spotlight on human suffering and that every life is valuable'.
