Early one morning, a bear was walking around a neighbourhood like a human in New Jersey, USA. Ian Bowman from Oak Ridge spotted the animal and quickly took out his phone to record the unusual sight. The bear was blissfully unaware of being filmed as he walked on his hind legs and took a casual stroll. After Ian uploaded the video online, other people in the neighbourhood reported that they had seen the same bear performing that same stunt.
