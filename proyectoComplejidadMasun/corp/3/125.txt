A 12-year-old Portuguese water dog named Hudson had her toe amputated due to arthritis. Her owner treats her pain by adding cannabis, also known as medical marijuana, into her food. The owner said that Hudson is now livelier, more engaged, and excited to go out for walks. He thinks that she seems to be in less pain, or if she is in pain, she 'doesn't care as much'. Twenty-eight US states have legalised the drug and more Americans are using it to treat their pets' conditions. Medical marijuana is still illegal under federal law in the United States, so veterinarians cannot prescribe it. Scientists also say that they do not have enough data to know if the drug is safe for pets. They warn owners that they are medicating their pets at their own risk.
