War-torn Yemen declared 'a state of emergency' after a deadly cholera outbreak. The capital's health office reported over 9,000 cases of the diarrhoea-causing disease which are seriously stretching resources. Despite help from UNICEF, Yemen is unable to deal with the crisis and hospitalise all the patients. The United Nations is urging the 200 donor countries to provide over 1 billion dollars that they pledged in Geneva.
