There are many old kitchen appliances in the UK. A delivery company has come up with a new idea on how to recycle them. It decided to make a bike. The entire bike is made out of kitchen appliances which are not used anymore. There are 12,000 riders delivering food in Britain and the rider of this bike will be one of them. The company is encouraging the nation to clean its homes from old appliances and let them be used for food delivery.
