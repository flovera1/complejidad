In Syria, US air-strikes were for the first time directed at one of President Assad's military bases. This was a reaction to a chemical weapons attack, which killed innocent civilians. However, Donald Trump's intervention has divided Syrian Americans. In New York people protested against America's reaction. The protesters were disappointed with Donald Trump's intervention. They voted for him because he promised not to be a policeman for the world. He promised to stay within America. One of the protesters said that this was one more war based on a total lie. However, a lot of Syrians welcomed what President Trump has done. Other Syrian Americans expressed a sense of hope that this action will get Syria rid of the murderous Assad regime. One person said that he thinks that the United States finally made a move for humanity and to help the Syrian people.
