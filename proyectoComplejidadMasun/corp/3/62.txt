A London Marathon runner saw a competitor who needed help. He had fallen to the ground, so he picked him up. When he fell down again, he decided to support him to the finish line 200 metres away. Matthew, the runner who selflessly helped his competitor, became an Internet sensation. The two runners became friends and are going to meet at races, and hopefully, next year's London Marathon, as well.
