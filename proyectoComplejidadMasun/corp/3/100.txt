A little piglet from Hawaii left the muddy sty behind and took to riding waves. Kama the pig loves nothing more than to surf, regularly joining his owner to catch some waves on the island's famous beaches. The owner first noticed his pig's unusual skills when he slipped and fell in the backyard pool and started to swim. Not long after, the little wonder pig started sharing a surfboard with his human friend, catching waves and turning heads at Hawaii's Sandy Beach. Everywhere Kama goes, he makes people smile and laugh, bringing joy to the world, just like surfing itself.
