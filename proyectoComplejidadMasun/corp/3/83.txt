A snow leopard broke into a sheep pen in China and ate so much that he could not make the jump back over the fence to escape. He eventually gave up and lay down for a little post-dinner snooze. Herdsmen later captured the big cat. Snow leopards are extremely rare, even more so than giant pandas, and are one of the highly-protected animals in China. They are listed on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. People found the leopard just under 1.5 metres in length and weighing around 100 kilograms, but they can get much bigger than that. Once officers managed to get him moving again, they released him back into the wild.
