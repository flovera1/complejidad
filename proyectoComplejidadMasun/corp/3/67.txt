Zookeepers from the Smithsonian's National Zoo wanted to give its animals some music lessons. They placed a keyboard and a toy xylophone in front of the small-clawed otters. While the otters enjoyed the keyboard, Bonnie the Orangutan enjoyed the xylophone. An animal enrichment programme brought the impromptu music lesson in order to bring more fun into the creatures' lives and to challenge and stimulate them. The zoo is part of the Smithsonian Institution, which is the home of the world's largest museum and research complexes. The zoo has 2,000 animals of around 400 species and two million visitors come each year.
