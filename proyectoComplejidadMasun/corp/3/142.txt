Thirty-eight-year-old Dwain Chambers, a former Team GB sprinter, is one of the fastest European sprinters ever recorded, but can he beat a racehorse? Chambers and thoroughbred Heat Storm had a 100-metre race at a racecourse in England. The human got off to a flying start, but the horse soon got close behind him. In the end, two legs proved to be faster than four on the 100-metre track. The athlete won in a time of 10.36 seconds.
