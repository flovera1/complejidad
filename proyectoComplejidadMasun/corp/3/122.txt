If you have ever wondered what it would be like to dance on the ceiling, you can actually give it a go at a fully upside down house in Shangai. The house by a Polish designer features a bathroom, bedrooms, a kitchen and a living area with everything upside down, including the furniture and cutlery. Visitors to the house say that it is a dizzying experience, with one tourist finding the bathroom most interesting. She kept feeling like water might be falling out of the loo.
