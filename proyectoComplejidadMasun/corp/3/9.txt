In Russia, people named a tiger Vladik that was prowling the suburbs of a city called Vladivostok. People caught Vladik so that they could send him back to the wild. They relocated the tiger to Bikin National Park, which is about 500 kilometres to the north. In the vast woodland, he can roam freely and thrive in the space without the danger of people. Russia protects Siberian tigers as people believe that there are only about 54 of them in the wild.
