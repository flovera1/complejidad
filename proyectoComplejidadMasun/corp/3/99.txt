A group of amateur scientists launched a pastry into the stratosphere. No one knows exactly why, but people took some dazzling and bizarre images of the dessert flying far above the earth. The fake pastry treat was stuck to a home-made spacecraft called the 'Cannolo Transporter' which was then attached to a large helium-filled balloon and released into the sky. The aircraft rose to at least 8.8 kilometres but came crashing back down to Earth after only two hours. The team reclaimed its precious invention in a muddy farmland.
