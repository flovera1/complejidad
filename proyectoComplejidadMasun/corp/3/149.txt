Elvis's former wife, Priscilla Presley, cut the ribbon to a new centre dedicated to the king of Rock 'n Roll in Memphis, Tennessee. Elvis died 40 years ago. Priscilla said that her husband was a giving man and he would have liked sharing the things that he accomplished with his fans. The 19,000 square-metre complex features memorabilia, cars, two restaurants, and retail stores. The complex replaces the ageing buildings that people had been visiting for years. Fans seemed 'all shook up' by what they saw. The complex is a part of a 140 million expansion to Graceland, including a 453-room hotel that opened last year.
