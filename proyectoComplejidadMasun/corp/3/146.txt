Residents of Onoway, a Canadian town, were shocked when they discovered that their tap water was pink. The local authorities had not released any information at the time, so people didn't know whether the water was safe or not. Only later were they informed that the water was safe, even despite its unusual bubblegum shade. The colour was caused by a leak of potassium permanganate, which people used to wash the town's water filters.
