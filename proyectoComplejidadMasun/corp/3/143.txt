A new hotel in Taiwan is offering guests the chance to go scuba diving without ever leaving the building, as it features a swimming pool of up to 21 metres in depth. Divers can explore a 'sunken ship' and a series of underwater caves, and they can give diners in the hotel's restaurant a wave through a large window. The hotel has 30 rooms and its design was inspired by Italy's 40-metre-deep 'Y-40', which is the deepest swimming pool in the world.
