Violent clashes erupted in Paris on Monday 27th over the killing of a Chinese man by police. Three police officers were injured and more than 30 people detained during the clashes. Fifty-six-year-old Liu Shaoyo was killed in his home on the previous day. Police say that they acted in self-defence after he attacked an officer with scissors. The family's lawyer rejected the account, and China said that it has filed an 'official complaint' with the French embassy.
