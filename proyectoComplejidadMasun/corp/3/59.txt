Californian Nick Stoeberl can officially say that he has the longest tongue in the world, as his tongue is 10.13 centimetres long. He beat the former world record holder Stephen Taylor from the UK. Nick says that his tongue is useful for conventional activities such as licking lollipops, eating ice cream or getting pudding from the bottom of a cup. However, strangers find his tongue bizarre. He says that when he meets someone new, he is introduced as having the longest tongue in the world, so he feels like he has to stick it out at them. That leaves the strangers with a weird impression. Nick's extraordinarily long tongue is one the most unusual new records to have made it into the 60th anniversary edition of the Guinness Book of World Records.
