Bill Kochevar was paralysed below his shoulders in a cycling accident eight years ago, but now with the help of new technology, he can move his right arm and hand again. There are electrodes under his skull to record the activity of brain neurons to generate signals, which tell another device to stimulate the muscles in his paralysed limb. People believe that the 56-year-old is the first person with quadriplegia to have this done, and the university in Ohio that is doing the research has shown the whole world that it is possible to reconnect the brain and make an arm move again.
