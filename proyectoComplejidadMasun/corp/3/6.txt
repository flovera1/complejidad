In recent years, Australia's south west state of Victoria saw a rapid increase of koalas, meaning that the animals have been literally eating themselves out of house and home by destroying gum trees. Their binging and booming population eventually caused them to starve. Environmentalists have moved 500 koalas over the past year, and their objective now is to control them and keep their numbers down. They gave the females contraceptive implants and then released them into other forests. However, it will be some years before the gum trees in their old patch grow back.
