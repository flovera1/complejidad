Panic loomed among the residents of an Indian village, when a leopard emerged from the rooftop of a house and ran wild. Just as the animal was found on the rooftop, residents could be seen clambering away from it in fear. The animal could then be seen attacking a man, as he tried to escape, and he fell over a wall. The animal, probably as scared as the residents, later ran into the bathroom of a hut to hide from the crowd. Luckily, nobody reported injuries in the incident.
