An unusual amount of rain hit Peru and it has recently been putting some 200,000 people at risk, killing at least 60 people this year and more than a dozen people in the last three days. Rescue teams are helping the families who have lost their livelihoods. A video recently emerged of a woman making a remarkable escape from a mudslide full of debris. You can see her walking herself to safety before she collapses from exhaustion. People then took her to hospital. People believe that she had no serious injuries.
