People discovered the oldest human footprints outside of Africa in Britain, dating back around a million years, making these footprints incredibly important finds. People found them on a beach on the Norfolk coast in the east of England, and they are direct evidence of the earliest known humans in Northern Europe. People first discovered the prints in May 2013 during low tide after the sand had eroded to reveal hollows resembling human footprints. Scientists recorded the surface using photogrammetry, which is a technique that can stitch together digital photographs to create a permanent record and a 3D image of an imprint. People then unveiled the images and a model at a news conference at the British Museum in London. Scientists now say that the amazing discovery will rewrite our understanding of human occupation of Britain and Europe.
