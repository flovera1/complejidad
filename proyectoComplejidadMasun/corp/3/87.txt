Palaeontologists in Argentina unearthed what they say is the remains of one of the world's largest dinosaurs. According to the team, the fossils, which people found in Patagonia, belonged to a sauropod, a very large quadrupedal herbivorous dinosaur with a long neck and tail, small head, and massive limbs, with initial tests dating the fossils back at around 90 million years old. The experts also found a large number of teeth from carnivorous animals, which will allow them to learn what types of food the group of dinosaurs ate, telling them how the ecosystem functioned some 100 million years ago. The palaeontologists began excavating the site in 2013, after a ranch employee said that he stumbled upon some fossils, with the team expecting to find at least seven more sets of remains.
