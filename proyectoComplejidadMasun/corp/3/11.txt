Hundreds of camels and camel trainers came to the Wadi Rum Desert in Jordan to race. Camel racing is a tradition and brings in crowds from all over the country. The racers competed for 400 Dinars (564 dollars) and bragging rights. Child racing is not allowed in Jordan, so trainers used robotic radio-controlled jockeys. Since there were so many racers, some eventually got the hump. One man said that he received second place and that it was a nice competition. Another man said that his camel failed so he received second and third place. The camels will race again after Ramadan.
