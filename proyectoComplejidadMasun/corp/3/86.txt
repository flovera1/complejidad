People saved a sow in South Africa from slaughter and now she lives out her days in an animal sanctuary. Her keeper noticed that she was very intelligent, so she placed a few balls and some paintbrushes and things in her pen. It wasn't long before the keeper discovered that the sow really liked the paintbrush. People nicknamed the sow 'Pigcasso' for her talent and love for painting that is best described as abstract expressionism. The sow's life of creativity is in a sharp contrast with ones that most pigs live  confinement in crates.
