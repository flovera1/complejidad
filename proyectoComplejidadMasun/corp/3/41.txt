A Croatian winemaker and diver has found a unique way to combine his two passions  he matures his wine at the bottom of the sea. The seabed is perfect for ageing wine, as it is dark, quiet, and has a stable temperature. The winemaker says that the resulting wine has a much more subtle taste than wine matured in cellars. Each bottle is placed in an amphora, which is a clay container used since ancient Greece, and the amphora is sealed with wax to protect it from seawater.
