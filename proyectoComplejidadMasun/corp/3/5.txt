In the time that it takes footballers to play one match, an astronaut in the International Space Station can pass from daytime to nighttime and back again, circling the planet earth completely. With each orbit, the station moves around 2,200 km to the west. A time-lapse video taken by the European Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst shows the view from space in under one minute. He set the camera to take an image every few seconds and then played the images back quickly to create the time-lapse effect. Gerst worked as geophysicist and volcanologist before the ESA chose him as an astronaut in 2009.
