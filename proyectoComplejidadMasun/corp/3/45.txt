About 200 inmates escaped from an overcrowded prison on Sumatra which is holding about 1,900 people despite its capacity of only 300 people. The inmates escaped on Friday when they were let out of their cells for Friday prayers. They overwhelmed the six guards on duty who the inmates accused of being violent. Hundreds of police and soldiers were deployed to the prison, and they set up roadblocks around the city. According to the Justice and Human Rights Ministry, they recaptured over half of the prisoners on that same day.
