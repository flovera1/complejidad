A pastor in Sierra Leone came across a jaw-dropping stone  a 706-carat (141 grams) diamond. It is the largest diamond to be found in Sierra Leone in over 40 years. When the pastor found it, he decided to hand it over to the government. Hoping that it may boost the development of the West African nation. The President of Sierra Leone said that he believed that a diamond like this should be publicly sold in the country, so that people will know the value of it and who the buyer is.
