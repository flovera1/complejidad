John, who is an associate geography professor at Western Kentucky University, was climbing a mountain in Nepal as part of a research project and fell into a crevasse. He filmed his struggle inside the 22-metre hole, saying that he thought that he was going to die after breaking his arm and five ribs, but he managed to crawl out the gap. It took him six hours, using only an ice axe, and another three to reach his tent, where he spent the night before rescuers reached him the next day.
