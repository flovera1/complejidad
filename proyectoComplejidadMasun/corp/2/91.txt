Isolated native people emerged from the Amazon rainforest, and made contact with the outside world. Someone filmed the moment on camera. The people wore loincloths and carried bows and arrows. They communicated with local villagers who gave them some bananas. The people took them, but they stepped back quickly. They were afraid of the strangers. Brazilian experts said that people from the rainforest move from Peru because of deforestation.
