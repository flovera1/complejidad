In Syria, someone used chemical weapons. Innocent civilians died. The US reacted with air-strikes. For the first time, the US directed the attack at one of President Assad's military bases. Donald Trump's intervention divided Syrian Americans. In New York, people protested against America's air-strikes on Syria. The protesters were unhappy with Donald Trump's intervention. They voted for him because he promised not to be a policeman for the world. He promised to stay in America. One of the protesters said that this was another war based on a total lie. However, a lot of Syrian Americans welcome what President Trump did. One of them said that he hopes that this action will end President Assad's leadership in Syria. He thinks that the United States finally made a move for humanity and to help the Syrian people.
