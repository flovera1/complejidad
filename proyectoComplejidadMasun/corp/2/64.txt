A man killed his neighbour in Arkansas in 1992 and he became a prisoner. Now he is the first prisoner in the state of Arkansas to be executed in over a decade. The spokesman of the governor spoke to the governor right after the execution. The governor was sad and had a message to the media in the media room. He said that it is a sad night for Arkansas and that he does not take it lightly. It is the one of the most sad things in his job. In the end, though, the right thing was done. Now, for the first time since 1993, there is justice for that neighbour's family. That is very important.
