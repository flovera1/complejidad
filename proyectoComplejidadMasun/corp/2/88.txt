French police shot dead a Chinese man in his home in Paris. The police say that the man attacked an officer with scissors, so they acted in self-defence. The lawyer of the family rejected the description, and China contacted the French embassy. The next day after the killing, people in Paris started to protest. Three police officers were injured and more than 30 people were arrested.
