An organisation rescued a rare albino orangutan from the jungle in Indonesia. A veterinarian said that she was in very bad condition when people rescued her. She was very stressed, had skin and hair problems and suffered from dehydration. The organisation which found her is asking people to suggest names for the orangutan. People hope that she will become a symbol of efforts to save orangutans.
