The staff at a company in Tokyo changed its office into a beach. People brought two tonnes of sand, speakers and a 3D projector. They did all of this to recreate a tropical beach in the reception area. The company wants to make its employees and visitors think that life can be a beach at work. One employee finds the sound of the waves relaxing. She also said that it helps her work. Some people even feel like they're already on holiday.
