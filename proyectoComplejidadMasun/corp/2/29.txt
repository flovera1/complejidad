This news is especially for cat lovers! A team of vets, scientists and sound artists created a keyboard for cats. You play it just like a normal keyboard, and it converts the sound into frequencies for cats. Both the keyboard player and the cats can enjoy the music! Part of a campaign designed the keyboard. The campaign is called the Pussy Cat Riot. This campaign is anti-Internet censorship. The first live show was a protest performance playing national anthems of countries that censor the Internet. The audience was, of course, made of cats.
