The Dubai Canvas Event is a 3D art festival. It showcases work from 25 artists from around the world. It is the first event which recognises 3D street art. The best artist wins some money. The artists worked outside on a busy walkway. That could make work more difficult, but the artists could talk about their work with people. The festival's director explained that the festival's goal is to let people know about this type of art. There are also four female artists in the festival.
