An astronaut at the International Space Station took an image every few seconds of the Earth. Then he played the images back quickly and created a time-lapse video. The video shows how the Earth spins. In the time it takes to play one football match, the ISS circles the planet completely. During a 90-minute period, astronauts can pass from daytime to nighttime and back again.
