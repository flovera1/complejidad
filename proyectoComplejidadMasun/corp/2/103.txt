An incredible image, which was taken in 2009 by the Hubble Space Telescope, has been released. A galaxy moves through a cluster of galaxies, and it is being ripped apart. It happens near the Great Attractor. This is a region in space around 200 million light years away from Earth. Scientists study the images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope for years because the images are very complex. The telescope has been taking pictures of space since 1990.
