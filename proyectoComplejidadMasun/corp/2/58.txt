There is a video of a birth of the last killer whale living in captivity. The calf was born to 25-year-old Takara in a Sea World in Texas. Sea World announced the end of its orca breeding programme last year. It was after the film 'Blackfish'. Some people started to worry about the benefits of orcas living in captivity. Animal rights campaigners want to move both the orcas into a wildlife reservation.
