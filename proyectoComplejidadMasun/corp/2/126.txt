In North London, someone put up an anti- Semitic road sign. It warned people about the presence of Jews near a synagogue. A Jewish community group spoke to the police about the sign. A Jewish leader said that the sign upset people, and reminded them 'of some of the darkest periods in recent Jewish history'. Later, people found out that the sign was supposed to be provocative, but not anti-Semitic. It was part of an art project by a French artist. He placed 27 signs showing similar figures around London. The artist apologised and said that he thought that his signs had no 'bad meanings'.
