When we cross the street we must wait for the green man on the crossing sign, but in one Australian city, he no longer wears trousers. The city of Melbourne is now in the news because it changed some of the pedestrian lights from men to women. A member of the Melbourne city board thinks that to see only a male figure is not right. She hopes that the female figure will make our world more equal. However, some of Melbourne's men ask if it is at all necessary. One of them said that for him, it is only a crossing light. He does not think of it is a male or a female figure. Melbourne's mayor is a man. He also is unsure that his daughters will feel better because the signs now show women. The lights will stay in place for at least one year.
