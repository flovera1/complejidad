A car bomb exploded outside a popular ice cream shop in Baghdad. The place was full of people at the time of the explosion. Thirteen people died and 30 more were injured. The attack took place at midnight when some Muslims break fasting during Ramadan. The Islamic State Group, which sees Iraq's Shia Muslims as heretics, claimed responsibility for the attack.
