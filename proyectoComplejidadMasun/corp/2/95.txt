A woman paints on her body and takes pictures of herself. She then puts the pictures together to create a stop-motion film. Her videos are amazing. She is is Chinese but she lives in Japan. Her interesting career started at home. She wanted to paint something, but she had nothing to paint on. So, she used her hand and painted an eye on it. It looked quite strange, so she took a picture of it. The artist says that people judge others by their appearances. She thinks that that is really stupid. She creates her films to send a message that things are not what they look like on the surface.
