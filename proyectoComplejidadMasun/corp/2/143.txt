There is a new hotel in Taiwan, which features a 21-metre-deep swimming and scuba-diving pool. Divers can explore a 'sunken ship' and a series of underwater caves. They can also give the hotel's diners a wave through a large window. The hotel has 30 rooms and its design was inspired by Italy's 40-metre-deep 'Y-40'. Y-40 is the deepest swimming pool in the world.
