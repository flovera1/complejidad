A car curling tournament happened in Russia. A series of accidents caused by black ice last autumn was the inspiration for the tournament. Four teams of 10 pushed small cars towards a target painted on an ice rink. Each team had three cars and nine attempts to get the cars as close to the centre as possible. People removed the heaviest parts of the cars before the event.
