Four years ago, dogs attacked a goat and he almost died. While he recovered on a farm, a rooster befriended him. The farm owner thinks that the rooster visited the elderly goat to get away from other roosters. The goat's rehabilitation took weeks and the rooster stayed with him for the whole time. A farm worker said that the rooster protected the goat, and she thinks that the rooster helped the goat heal because he had a friend. She said that now the rooster goes everywhere that the goat goes. He sleeps with him and rides on him. They are now inseparable friends.
