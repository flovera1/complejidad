In Baghdad, a bookworm turned his van into a mobile bookshop. He makes up to 4,000 a month selling books around the city. He has done well enough to hire four people to help him. The man said that it took him nine months to achieve his idea and he hopes that it brings more people to reading. As the man moves his van, he changes the books that people can see. This is because Baghdad is still divided on their past leader Saddam Hussein.
