A sailor was trying to tie up his boat when he accidentally knocked the throttle. The boat started moving and threw the man overboard. The six-metre-long speedboat began to move in a circle. Luckily, somebody spotted the boat and let others know. Lifeboat crew got a line aboard the boat and managed to reduce the speed. The owner of the boat got safely to shore, but he had to go to hospital.
