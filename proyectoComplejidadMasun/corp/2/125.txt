A 12-year-old dog had arthritis and doctors amputated her toe. Now her owner treats the pain by adding cannabis to her food. The dog's owner says that his dog seems happier, livelier and in less pain. If she is in pain, she does not 'care as much'. Twenty-eight American states have legalised the drug and as a result, more Americans use it to treat their pets' conditions. Cannabis is still illegal according to federal law in the United States, which means that veterinarians cannot prescribe it. Also, scientists say that they cannot say if it is safe for pets.
