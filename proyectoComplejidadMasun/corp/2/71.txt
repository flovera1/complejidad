A leopard appeared from the rooftop of a house in India. People panicked. They clambered away from the animal in fear. The animal attacked the man when he tried to escape. The leopard then strayed into the village and hid in a hut. It was probably as scared as the people. Luckily, no one else was injured in the incident.
