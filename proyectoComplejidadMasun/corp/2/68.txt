A military lover bought a tank on the internet. He paid 30,000. He and his mechanic repaired the tank. They were afraid that there were guns inside it. When they opened it, they found gold. They found 2 million in gold inside. The man called the police. The police took the gold away for investigation and gave him a receipt.
