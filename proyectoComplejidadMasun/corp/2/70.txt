In Belgium, there is a special flower in a botanic garden. It is famous for its foul smell, but it does not stop visitors from sticking their noses into it. The flower rarely blooms outside Indonesia, and it takes between three and ten years for it to mature. The flower smells like old meat, which attracts insects. Its stinky red leaves stay open only for two days.
