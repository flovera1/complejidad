Last month, an unusual thief visited a jewellery shop. The thief was a monkey. First, an employee of the shop noticed the monkey sitting outside the shop door and he offered a piece of fruit to the monkey. Shortly after that, the unsatisfied monkey pushed open the door and went inside the shop. He took a seat in an office chair, relaxed, then took some money and ran off with it. The employee tried to offer the monkey a banana in exchange for the money, but the thief did not want it and escaped into the street with about 10,000 rupees, which is about 150 US dollars. Shop staff said that they saw this monkey before. They will be more careful now if he comes back again.
