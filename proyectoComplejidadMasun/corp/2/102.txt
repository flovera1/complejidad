After she ran out of petrol, a 24-year-old student survived alone at the Grand Canyon for five days. As she had no mobile phone signal, she used rocks to spell out 'HELP'. Eventually, a paramedic in a helicopter saw her. Other helicopters flew by when she was at the Grand Canyon, but they did not see her. When this helicopter came to land near her, she started to cry. The paramedic came up to her and asked her if she needed help.
