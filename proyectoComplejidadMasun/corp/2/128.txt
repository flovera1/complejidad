Archaeologists in Egypt found an ancient statue. It is very big. They moved it at night. They did not want to be stopped by the daily traffic. It is a torso. It weights three tons. It is probably a statue of one of the most famous pharaohs in Egypt. Historians think that it is a statue of Ramses II. He ruled Egypt for 60 years over 3000 years ago. Historians will put the parts of the statue together and restore them at the Egyptian museum in Cairo. An Egyptian-German archaeological team discovered the statue.
