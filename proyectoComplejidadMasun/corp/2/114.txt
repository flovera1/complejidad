A medical team in the US did an operation that changed the life of a baby. Dominique was born with four legs and two spines. They were parts of a twin. The twin was connected to the back of Dominique's neck. There were legs that moved and feet that came out of the back of her neck. This was extremely dangerous for the baby. Thanks to the hard work of a medical team, she got a new chance at life. One of the doctors said that the operation was very difficult. The most critical part was the connection of the two spines. After that, the doctors knew that the operation would be successful. Dominique left the hospital five days after the surgery. She is now in the care of an American foster family. People expect that she can live a full and normal life now.
