In February, a husband and wife went on a cruise, and the wife disappeared. In Rome, police arrested the husband. At an Italian port, a boat owner saw a suitcase floating in the water and picked it up. He wanted to see what was inside, so he unzipped it and found a black bag in the shape of a person. Italian police wonder if this is the body of the wife. The husband's lawyer says that the body is too tall to be hers, but the police are still working on the crime.
