A 23-foot python (7 metres) had her annual check-up. The snake is the biggest one in Europe. It weighs around 60 kilograms. Ten people from the zoo carried her to the vet and they checked her heart with ultrasound. Doctors can tell a lot about the health of the hearth like this. The experts tried similar tests on giraffes and sharks, but snake hearts interest them more. A snake's heart has three chambers, not four like the human heart.
