Holi is an Indian festival of colour. It is celebrated in the northern Indian city of Vrindavan, which is known as the City of Widows. There is a number of widowed women in the city who have found shelter there. They danced with tourists who came to see the festival. An Indian man started organising the celebrations in 2013. A widow from a care home for the elderly said that they do not feel like widows any more. Their lives are much better thanks to this man.
