A helicopter was trying to land on a superyacht, but it crashed into the water. It happened in a Norwegian harbour and someone filmed it on camera. Three British citizens were onboard the helicopter and were injured. It is possible that a tarpaulin got stuck in the helicopter's rotors. Both Britain and Norway are investigating the incident.
