A runner at this year's London Marathon fell down. He was exhausted. Another runner helped him up, but he fell down again. The finish line was only 200 metres away, so the man helped him to it. It was nice of the man to help his competitor. People share this story on the Internet. The two runners became friends, and they want to meet at races in the future  next year's London Marathon, as well.
