A fully upside down house was built in Shanghai. It features a bathroom, bedrooms, a kitchen and a living area. The house is a place where everything is turned upside down, including furniture and even the cutlery. Many visitors are shocked and dizzy. One tourist said that the most interesting room was the bathroom. She felt like the water might be falling out of the toilet. Polish designers created the house, and it took five months to build. The house was opened to the public last week.
