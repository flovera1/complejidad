This news is about an 84-year-old woman from the UK. Her name is Ursula and she left school in 1944 unable to read. She had no time to learn to read because she had to look after her ill parents. Ursula felt sad that she could not read the papers or books like other people. She decided to learn to read now, in her 80s. She hopes that she can inspire other people to read too.
