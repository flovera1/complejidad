A woman found a cat in an alley in Chicago. That woman who is now the cat's owner and trainer took her in and named her Alley. The woman soon realised that the cat had a very special talent. The cat was at first able to jump only two feet, but then it was three, four, five and finally six feet. The cat was once a frail kitty, but now it is a star. The cat set a new Guinness World Record and it also tours the USA with its owner.
