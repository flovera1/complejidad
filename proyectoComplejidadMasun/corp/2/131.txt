There is a beauty centre for cats and dogs in Russia. It provides similar services like spas for humans. Your pet can get a massage, do aqua aerobics, walk on a treadmill, or do fit ball exercises with a personal coach. A dog owner explained that if you get a dog, you have to care for it. You must keep it in shape, bathe it, and feed it properly. This is easier with the help of the centre. Haircuts, fur masks and pedicures are very popular. The set costs around 20 US dollars.
