A group of scientists launched a pastry into the stratosphere. No one knows why they did it, but an amazing video was filmed. The fake pastry was stuck to a home-made spacecraft. The spacecraft was then attached to a big balloon and released into the sky. The balloon rose to at least 29,000 feet (8,839 metres), but it started to fall down only in two hours. The amateur scientists then reclaimed their invention.
