Little lions at a zoo in Washington must pass a swimming test. Four ten-week-old cats were thrown into the water by the staff. All four cubs held their heads above the water, and three of them swam to the shallow end of the moat. One, however, got quickly out of the water the same way he entered. The small cats at the zoo must pass this test. They must show that they are strong enough, and that water is no danger to them.
