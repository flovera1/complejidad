In the Victoria State in Australia, there were too many koalas. This was a problem because the koalas ate all of the trees and then they had nothing to eat. Last year, people moved 500 koalas, and they want to keep their numbers down. They gave the females contraceptive implants and moved them to other forests. However, it will be some years before the destroyed gum trees grow back.
