A man went for a swim in a beautiful, remote park in Mexico. He got the shock of his life when a huge crocodile appeared and started following him. The man swam to shore as fast as he could to escape the croc. The incident was watched by a group of tourists who were on a bridge. Luckily, one of them had a good idea. He or she threw a big object into the water to make the crocodile stop.
