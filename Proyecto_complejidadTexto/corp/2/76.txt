In Colombo, Sri Lanka, a hill of trash sat next to a poor neighbourhood. The residents there lived in tiny homes and protested against the situation, but then the worst happened. The trash fell down onto the homes, killed 17 people, and injured 13 more. Soldiers looked for other people who might be trapped. Over 600 people had to leave. One man said that they protested to the police before the incident, but the police beat them and arrested them. He said that now the police were there to help, but what could they do now?
