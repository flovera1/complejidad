Tourists at a zoo in Thailand left behind their junk food, and a monkey ate it. He became so fat that people started to call him 'Uncle Fat'. He is 26 kilograms heavy  three times the normal weight. A vet explained how dangerous the mass of fat is. In the end, it can lead to heart diseases. Zookeepers placed the monkey on a strict diet. He eats only lean protein, fruit and vegetables.
