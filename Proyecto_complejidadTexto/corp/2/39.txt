Along South Africa's east coast, sardines began their migration that lasts from April to July. It occurs in different locations around the coast. People named it the 'sardine run', and the huge shoal of fish is five to seven kilometres long. Dolphins and other animals that eat fish see the sardine run as a lot of food, while scientists see it as a time to research. They learned that reproducing adults and young fish are in the sardine run.
