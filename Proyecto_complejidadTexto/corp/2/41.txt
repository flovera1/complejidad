A Croatian winemaker and diver found a way to combine his two hobbies. He matures his wine at the bottom of the sea. The seabed is perfect for ageing wine. It is dark, quiet, and the temperature is stable. He says that the wine tastes better if it matures down there. He puts each bottle into a clay container and sealed with wax, so it is protected from seawater.
