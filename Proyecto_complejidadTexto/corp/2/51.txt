The C919 is the first Chinese-built passenger jet. People designed it to compete with the Airbus 320 and the Boeing 737. It took off from Shanghai on its 80-minute maiden flight. The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) made the jet. The state media described the debut as 'another fulfilment of a Chinese dream.'
