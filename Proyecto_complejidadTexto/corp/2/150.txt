An Icelandic reality show is helping homeless kittens get new homes through work with a cat protection organisation. The idea behind the reality show is that four rescue kittens move into a doll house for up to 3 to 4 weeks at a time, and they are filmed for many hours a day. So far, the show has been a success. Many of the kittens have been re-homed, and as they get adopted, new homeless kittens take their places.
