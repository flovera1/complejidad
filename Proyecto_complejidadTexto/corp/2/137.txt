Antonin Stradivari, the world's renowned violin maker, made violins in the 1700s. Only about 550 violins made by him exist now. He made one violin called the Ames Stradivarius in 1734, which is probably worth millions of dollars. Someone stole that violin from a musician in 1980. Decades later, the thief, who was another violinist, showed his ex-wife a locked violin case. In 2015, she took that violin for an appraisal and found out what it was. The family of the owner received the violin back. A Chinese woman who came to study under the true owner of the violin played it in New York City on March 13th.
