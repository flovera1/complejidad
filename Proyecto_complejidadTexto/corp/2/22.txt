In Caracas, Venezuela, police and protesters fought over the government of the current president. People have been protesting violently for over a month because they want new elections. Police hit the protesters with tear gas, and many hid behind their makeshift shields to protect themselves. In the middle of all this, one protester stayed calm and played his violin.
