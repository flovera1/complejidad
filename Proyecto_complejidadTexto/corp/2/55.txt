An American university professor was climbing in Nepal when he fell down a hole. The crack in the ice was 22 metres deep, and the man got trapped in it. The man thought that he was going to die. His arm and five ribs were broken, but he didn't give up and he moved out of the gap. It took him six hours. He reached his tent in another three hours. Help came the next day.
