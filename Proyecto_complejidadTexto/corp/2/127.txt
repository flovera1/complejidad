There are many old kitchen appliances in the UK. A delivery company came up with an idea. It made a new bike. The bike is made out of kitchen appliances which are not used anymore. The new bike is one of 12,000 bikes used for delivering food across Britain. The company is encouraging people to clean their homes from old appliances and let them be used for food delivery.
