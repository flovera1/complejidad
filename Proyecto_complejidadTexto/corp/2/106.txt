Twenty years ago, the rapper Biggie Smalls died in Los Angeles. A US congressman who represents New York wanted to pay tribute to the rapper, as the rapper lived in his district in his past. The congressman rapped while he talked about the rapper's story. He said that he went from being poor to being rich, and this showed a real example of the American Dream.
