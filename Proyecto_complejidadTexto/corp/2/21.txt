A car killed a teenager and injured 22 people in New York. The car drove the wrong way into Times Square, mounted the pavement, and drove into people. The driver then jumped out and started running, but people stopped him. The driver is a 26-year-old American named Richard Rojas. He served in the army and drove drunk before. Officials believe that the incident was not an act of terror.
