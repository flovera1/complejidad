In Yemen, there was an outbreak of cholera. People reported over 9,000 cases of the disease. The African country does not have enough room in hospitals. Before the cholera, there was war in Yemen, and now it does not have enough resources to fight the disease. The UN is asking for 1 billion dollars that countries promised in Geneva.
