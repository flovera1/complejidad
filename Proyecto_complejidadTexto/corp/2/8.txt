People bought a white diamond at a car boot sale in England back in the 1980s. They thought that it was just costume jewellery because they bought it just for 10. However, they had the 26.27 carats (5.3 grams) stone valued recently. They found out that it was a real diamond, and that it is going on sale for around 350,000. The owners say that they are extremely excited.
