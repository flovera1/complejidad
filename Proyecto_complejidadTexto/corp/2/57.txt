A one-year-old boy was playing outside his mother's shop in China. The mother was not with the baby, so she didn't see him when he walked away. Later, a security camera on a bus filmed the baby boy  he boarded the bus on his own. The driver and the passengers saw that no adult was with the baby, so the driver stopped the bus and people called the police. Passengers took care of the baby until the officers came. They found the parents of the baby an hour later.
