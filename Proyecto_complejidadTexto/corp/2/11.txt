In a desert in Jordan, hundreds of camels and their trainers came to race. Camel racing is a tradition and crowds from all over the country came to see it. The winner received 400 Dinars (564 dollars) and bragging rights. Jordan does not allow child racing, so trainers used robotic radio-controlled jockeys. After Ramadan, the camels will race again.
