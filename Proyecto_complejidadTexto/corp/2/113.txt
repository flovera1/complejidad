An incredible video emerged. It shows a two-year-old skateboarder in action. The little boy is from Australia and he could be the most amazing skateboarder ever. He comes from a family of skateboard enthusiasts, and he has been practising since he was just six months old. The age when most of us can't even walk yet! In the video, he skates down the streets and hops over curbs on his board.
