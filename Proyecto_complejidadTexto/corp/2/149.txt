Elvis Presley died 40 years ago. Elvis's ex-wife, Priscilla Presley, opened a new 19,000 square-metre centre about her husband in Memphis, Tennessee. Priscilla said that her husband was a giving man. She thinks that he would like the centre because he liked sharing his accomplishments with his fans. The centre has memorabilia, cars, shops, and two restaurants. It is part of a 140 million expansion to Graceland, which was Presley's home. The expansion includes a 453-room hotel that opened last year.
