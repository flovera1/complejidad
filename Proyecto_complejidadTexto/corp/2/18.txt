A rare phenomenon appeared in Mongolia. It looked like there were three suns in the sky! The sun in the middle was real. The two other suns on the left and on the right were the sun's smaller reflections. This phenomenon appears only in very specific conditions. The temperature must be lower than -30 and the air must be filled with clouds and vapour.
