In Russia, a Siberian tiger prowled the suburbs of a city, so people caught him to send him back to the wild. They moved him to a national park about 500 kilometres to the north. In the woods, he can live freely and thrive. Russia protects Siberian tigers, as people believe that there are only about 54 of them left in the wild.
