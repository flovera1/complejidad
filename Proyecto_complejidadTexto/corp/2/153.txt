A balloon festival is taking place in three Tunisian cities  Hammamet, Tunis and Sousse. Teams from around the world gathered in a field in Hammamet. There were 25 balloons and up to 90 participants taking part. This is the event's third year. One pilot explained that you can land anywhere, but you also have to drive to the balloon to collect it. Landing in the desert is something new to him. A Lithuanian balloon crew member called ballooning the safest of all air transportation because there is almost no danger.
