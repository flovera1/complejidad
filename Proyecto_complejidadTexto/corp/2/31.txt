Most people don't like cockroaches, but one man from China is an exception. He has a cockroach farm which brings him a fortune. He has nearly one square mile of the bugs, and one kilo of them sells for 16. People use cockroach shells and oil in Chinese medicine to treat a lot of diseases. However, these medical products say nothing about the cockroaches on their information packets. The reason why is clear. But, the farmer is proud of his cockroach farm anyway.
