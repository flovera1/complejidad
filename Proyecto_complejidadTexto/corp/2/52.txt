A boy was ill and doctors diagnosed him with a migraine and sent him home. His mother said that something was wrong because her son was acting differently. He was very angry and he was vomiting. He drew a picture of the pain in his head on his Etch-A-Sketch and described it as a  lump '. His mother took a picture of his drawing and brought it to the doctors to highlight her worries. Doctors did a brain scan and found that her son had a deadly brain tumour. They performed an operation, and he is now getting better at home.
