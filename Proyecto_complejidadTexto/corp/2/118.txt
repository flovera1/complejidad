Somebody installed a special screen at a London bus stop. The screen uses a special type of technology to shock people. It has a camera so it shows what's behind it, but a little differently. It adds videos of an alien invasion, giant robots or a tiger on the run. It was a little scary for some people, and their reactions were incredible. They were caught on camera.
