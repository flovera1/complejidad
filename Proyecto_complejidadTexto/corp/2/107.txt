The oldest human footprints in Europe have been discovered in Britain. There are only three other sets of footprints that are older and they are in Africa. Scientists took digital photographs of the footprints and created a 3D image from them. The images and model were unveiled at a news conference at the British Museum in London. Scientists think that most of the footprints are children's. There was at least one adult, too. Discoveries of ancient man's footprints are extremely rare. Scientists say that the discovery will rewrite our understanding of human occupation of Britain and Europe.
