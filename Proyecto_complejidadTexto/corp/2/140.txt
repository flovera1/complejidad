National Geographic Wild introduced the first animatronic leopard. The channel created the big cat to inform about serious threats to the animal. The channel introduced it at the beginning of the Big Cat Week on the channel. Someone put the leopard on the streets of London and it scared some local people. The creator worked for over two months on the animatronic cat. He explained that on the street, the cat will just be lying down and doing almost nothing. It will just move its tail from one side to another. But when people go near, it will start to make noises and will move its face. The main threat to leopards is the destruction of 90% of their natural environment. The big cats must share their territory with people. This project wants to inform people about the problem and start new strategies to help the big cat. It wants to reduce human and big cat conflicts.
