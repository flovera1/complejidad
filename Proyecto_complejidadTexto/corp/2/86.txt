People saved a sow in South Africa from slaughter, and now she lives in an animal sanctuary. Her keeper noticed that she was very intelligent, so the keeper gave her a few balls and paintbrushes. The keeper noticed that the sow was interested in the paintbrush, and that she likes paint. People now call the sow 'Pigcasso' for her talent and love for painting. Her work is abstract expressionism.
