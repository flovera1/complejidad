Zookeepers at a zoo in the USA let some of the animals play. The otters play the keyboard, and an orangutan played the xylophone. The music lesson was part of an animal enrichment programme. The programme wants to bring more fun into animals' lives. The zoo is home to around 2,000 animals of around 400 species, and it receives around two million visitors each year.
