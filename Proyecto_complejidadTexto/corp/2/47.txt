A 16-year-old Muslim girl wore a hijab during a boxing match. She became the first person in the USA to do this. She lost the match but later said that it was not about winning. She felt that she had a purpose, as she fought for what she believes in. She believes that all girls should have a chance. Now she wants to change the international rules as well, so she can compete in a hijab at the 2020 Olympics. The teenager hopes that she inspired others to fight for what they believe in.
