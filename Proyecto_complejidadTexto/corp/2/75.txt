A man was skydiving in Norway when something hurtled by him. He thinks it was a meteorite! He filmed the video in 2012. Over the past two years, the man tried to find out if it really was a meteorite. He believes it was. Most meteorites burn up when they enter Earth's atmosphere. However, some meteorites survive and they are extinguished 20 kilometres above the Earth. The man believes he captured this type of meteorite on video. Now he works with Norway's Space and Meteorite Centre. It tries to locate the meteor.
