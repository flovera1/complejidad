Eight years ago, a man was paralysed below his shoulders in a cycling accident. Now, thanks to new technology, he can move his right arm and hand again. There are electrodes in his head that record the activity of his brain. They generate signals which tell another device to stimulate the muscles in his arm. The 56-year-old is the first person with quadriplegia to move again.
