A camera captured a funny moment in Minnesota. It showed a wedding party on a dock. There were 22 people there and the dock was small. The dock collapsed. A couple of bridesmaids ran away, but the rest of the people were in waist-deep water. As the guests arrived for the wedding, the wedding party was still wet.
