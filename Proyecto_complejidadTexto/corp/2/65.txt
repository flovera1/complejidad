Scientists used a clever new filming technique to film whales in Antarctica: they attached cameras onto the whales' bags. Using suction cups, they attached digital tags onto the whales' backs, which also have sensors and a camera. The scientists hope that the tags will get information on the whales' feeding areas to get them more protection, as well as give a short look into their world.
