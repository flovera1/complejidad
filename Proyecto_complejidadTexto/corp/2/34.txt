Twelve swimmers swam about 10 kilometres across the border of the US to Mexico. They did it to support human rights and to show their solidarity with the world. The athletes swam from Imperial Beach in California to Mexico. A hundred schoolchildren met them and cheered when they got to their destination. The event organiser said that the swim was not a protest. She said that it was a swim for human rights, a way to bring attention to people's trouble, and to show that every life is important.
