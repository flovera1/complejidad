Three tiger cubs were rejected by their mother, so they are being raised by a step dog mum. The two twin girls and their older brother are having a great time with their new step family. They play a lot with their step brothers and sisters. The cubs love playing a game of ball and getting their claws into somebody. They are really cute and they have become stars at a safari park in China's Zhejiang Province. But it won't be all fun and games forever. The cubs are expected to be reunited with their parents soon.
