North Korea tried to launch a missile, and the USA reacted. It sent an aircraft carrier to the Korean waters last week. A supply vessel needed to sail to the carrier, and a Japanese warship went with it to protect it. It is the largest Japanese warship. It is the helicopter carrier Izumo. The situation in the region is getting more and more serious. North Korea threatens to sink the American carrier.
