An Israeli company developed a small square chip. Each side measures 4.76 millimetres. This chip is tiny, but it contains the New Testament in the original Greek version. All 27 books of it are written on the chip. The company plans to mass produce it and put it in everyone's pockets. Because it is so small, it fits inside watches and jewellery. The possibilities are limitless. The company also plans to produce a chip with the Old Testament.
