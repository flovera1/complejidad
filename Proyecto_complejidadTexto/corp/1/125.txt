A 12-year-old dog has arthritis. Doctors remove her toe. She is in pain. Her owner gives her cannabis. He puts it in her food. The owner says that his dog is happier. He says that she is in less pain. Twenty-eight American states make cannabis legal. More Americans give it to their pets to help them. However, cannabis is still illegal in the USA. Veterinarians cannot tell owners to give it to their pets. Also, experts do not know if it is safe for pets.
