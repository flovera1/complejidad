When we cross the street, we wait for a sign that shows a green man. In one Australian city, this green man does not wear trousers. The city of Melbourne is now in the news because it changes a man to a woman on some traffic lights. An important lady from Melbourne says that it is not OK when we see only a green man on the sign. She thinks that we also need a green woman. Some of Melbourne's men do not think the same. One of them says that for him it is only a light. He does not think of it is a man or a woman. The mayor of Melbourne is a man. He also is not sure about the change. He thinks that it will not help women feel any better. The plan is to have these new crossing lights in the city for one year at least.
