In Syria, there is an attack with chemical weapons. Many people die. The US reacts. It attacks Syria by air. It attacks President Assad's military bases for the first time. This upsets some Syrian Americans. In New York people protest against America's reaction. The protesters are not happy with Donald Trump. They vote for him. He promises not to be a policeman for the world. He promises to stay in America. However, a lot of Syrian Americans welcome President Trump's actions. One of them hopes that this action can end President Assad's leadership in Syria. He thinks that the United States is trying to help people in Syria.
