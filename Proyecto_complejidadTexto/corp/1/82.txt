A man has a cycling accident. He cannot move below his shoulders. However, there is new technology. It lets the man move his right arm and hand again. There are electrodes in his head. They record his brain. They send signals to another device. This device tells the muscles in his arm to move. The man is 56 years old. He is the first person with paralysis to move again.
