Scientists find a special asteroid. The asteroid is in front of a star. It is 250 kilometres wide. The scientists are surprised. The asteroid has two rings. People thought that only big planets have rings. This is not true. Small objects have rings, too. This asteroid is the smallest object that has rings. We don't how the rings are formed. They are probably made of ice and rocks.
