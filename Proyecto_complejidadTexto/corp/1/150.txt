In Iceland, there is a new reality show. It is about kittens! People work on the show with a cat protection organisation. The reality show is about four rescue kittens. They move into a doll house. There are many cameras there to film them. They stay at the doll house for 3 to 4 weeks at a time. The show is a success. People adopt many of the kittens. New kittens get to move into the house. They can get adopted, too.
