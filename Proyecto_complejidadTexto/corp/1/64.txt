In 1992, a man kills his neighbour. He becomes a prisoner. This happens in Arkansas. Now, the state of Arkansas kills the prisoner after a very long time. The governor has a message to the media. He says that it is a sad night for Arkansas. It is not easy for him. It is one of the most sad things in his job. In the end it is the right thing. It is justice for the neighbour's family. That is very important.
