In North London, someone puts up a sign. The sign is near a synagogue. The sign shows that Jewish people are nearby. A Jewish community group speaks to the police. They say that the sign is anti- Semitic. Later on, people find out more about the sign. It is supposed to be provocative. It is not supposed to be anti-Semitic. The sign is part of an art project. The project is by a French artist. He puts up 27 signs around London. The artist says that he is sorry. He says that his signs have no 'bad meanings'.
