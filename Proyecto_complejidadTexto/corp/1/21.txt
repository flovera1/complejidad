Something bad happens in New York. A car drives the wrong way in Times Square. It goes onto the pavement. It drives into people. It kills a teenager. It injures twenty-two people. The driver than jumps out of the car. He starts running, but people stop him. The driver is 26 years old. He is American. His name is Richard Rojas. He was in the army. He drove drunk before.
