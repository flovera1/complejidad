In a zoo in Thailand, tourists leave behind their junk food. A monkey eats it. He becomes very fat. People call him 'Uncle Fat'. He is 26 kilograms heavy. That is three times more than normal. It is very dangerous to be this fat. It can lead to diseases. He can get a heart disease, for example. Zookeepers place the monkey on a diet. He eats only lean protein, fruit and vegetables.
