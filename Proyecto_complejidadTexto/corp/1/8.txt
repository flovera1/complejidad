People go to a car boot sale. They buy a diamond for 10. They think that it is just costume jewellery. This is back in the 1980s. Now, the people have the stone valued. They find out that it is a real diamond! It is 26.27 carats (5.3 grams) heavy. It goes on auction for around 350,000. The people are very happy.
