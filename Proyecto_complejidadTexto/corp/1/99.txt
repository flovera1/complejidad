There's a group of people. They want to send a fake pastry into the stratosphere. They use a big balloon. The balloon is filled with gas. It takes the pastry up. It gets up to 29,000 feet (8,839 metres). There's a camera on the balloon, too. It films an interesting video. After two hours up there, the balloon starts to go down. The people then find it.
