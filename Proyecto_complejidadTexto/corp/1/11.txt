Camels and their trainers come to a desert in Jordan. They come to race. Camel racing is a tradition in Jordan. Crowds come to watch. The racers want to win money. The winner receives 400 Dinars (564 dollars). Children cannot race in Jordan. Trainers use small radio-controlled jockeys on the camels. After Ramadan, the camels race again.
