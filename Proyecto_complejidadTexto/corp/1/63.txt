In Baghdad, a man changes his van. He turns it into a mobile bookshop. It takes him nine months to start his business. Now he makes up to 4,000 a month. He does very well. The man hopes that his bookshop makes people think about reading. As he moves his van, the man changes the books. He does this because people in Baghdad have different opinions. They feel differently about Saddam Hussein.
