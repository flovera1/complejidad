A boy is sick. Doctors say that he has a bad headache. His mother thinks that it is something else. Her son acts differently. He is angry. He vomits at night. He draws a picture on his Etch-A-Sketch. He draws the pain in his head. His mother takes a picture of the drawing. She shows it to the doctors. Doctors do a brain scan on the boy. They find a deadly brain tumour. They do an operation. The boy is now getting better at home.
