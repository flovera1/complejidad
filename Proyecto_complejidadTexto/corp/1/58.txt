There is a video about a killer whale baby. The baby orca was born in Sea World park in Texas. Its mother is 25 years old. Her name is Takara. This is the last baby orca born in the park. It is the end of the breeding programme in Sea World. Some people worry about orcas which do not live in the open ocean. Activists want to move the mother and the baby into a wildlife reservation.
