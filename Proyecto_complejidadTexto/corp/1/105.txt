Two men make videos and upload them on YouTube. They use a special camera. The camera films things in slow motion. The men have a new video. It is already very popular. In the video, they blow up a watermelon. One of the men sits close to it. He is covered by pieces of the watermelon! The men do this for three years. They film different types of things.
