In Egypt, a bus is going to a Coptic holy site. Gunmen shoot at the bus. They kill 28 Egyptian Christians. Nobody claims responsibility for the attack. However, last month, the Islamic State attacks Christians twice. The Egyptian government adds more protection for the Christians. The president says that he will punish who attacks them. Unfortunately, Islamist groups keep saying that they will attack the Christians.
