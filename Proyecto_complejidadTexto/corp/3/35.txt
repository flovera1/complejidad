An organisation rescued a rare albino orangutan from the jungle in Indonesia. A veterinarian said that she was in very bad condition when people rescued her. She was very stressed, had skin and hair problems, and suffered from dehydration. The Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, which found her, is asking the public to suggest names for the animal. They hope that the rare ape will become a symbol of efforts to save the endangered species.
