Thousands of supporters of the presidential candidate Francios Fillon met in Paris. The meeting should decide whether the candidate stays in the presidential race as he faces corruption charges. He supposedly arranged jobs in the parliament for his wife and children which they never performed. That is the reason that he was asked to pull out of the race. The candidate thanked to his supporters for coming to the meeting. Although there were many people at the meeting, it is still not sure whether he will stay in the presidential race.
