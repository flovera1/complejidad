A car bomb exploded outside a popular ice cream shop in Baghdad, striking in the holy month of Ramadan when Muslims fast during daylight hours. Someone placed the bomb inside a parked car and detonated it remotely, killing 13 people and injuring at least 30 more. The explosion took place at around midnight when restaurants and cafes are full of families breaking their fast. The Islamic State Group, which considers Iraq's Shia Muslims majority to be heretics, claimed responsibility for the attack saying the suicide bomber targeted a 'gathering of Shia'. Meanwhile, Iraqi troops are slowly pushing the jihadists out of their stronghold in Mosul in the north of Iraq.
