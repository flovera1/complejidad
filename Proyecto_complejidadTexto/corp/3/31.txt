A long-time a lover of creepy crawlies, a 32-year-old Chinese man got the idea for a cockroach farm after a friend who worked in a pharmacy told him about the use of bugs as a cheap source of protein and medication. The man gave up his job and moved to the country to live among the bugs. The cockroaches sell for 16 a kilo, which does not sound like a lot, but brings the farmer a fortune from his crop. Cockroach shells and oils are used in Chinese medicine to treat everything from heart disease to hepatitis and burns. Unsurprisingly, however, many people are not so keen on smearing themselves in cockroach oil, so it is not usually marketed as what it really is.
