A sailor in England was trying to tie up his boat when he accidentally knocked the throttle and was thrown overboard. He had already unclipped the kill cord and pushed the throttle lever to full power, as he fell into the water. The six-metre-long speedboat began to circle the quay. Luckily though, a member of the public spotted it and raised alarm. A lifeboat crew managed to get a line aboard the spinning boat, reach the throttle lever, and reduce the speed. The boat's owner managed to get ashore safely and was rushed to hospital.
