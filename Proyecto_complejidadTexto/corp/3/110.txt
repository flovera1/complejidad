The Dubai Canvas Event is a 3D art festival that showcases the works of 25 artists from around the world. There is a cash prize for the wining artist, and it is the world's first award to recognise excellence in 3D art. The artists are working outside on a busy walkway, which could be difficult, but it has its perks. One artist said that doing the art outdoors and with public interaction is special because he has immediate audience feedback. The director of the festival explained that the festival is about broadening the Emirati skill set and increasing awareness of this type of art. Four female Emirati artists are also in the festival. One artist said that she is working on a piece about imagination and reality tied together to show happiness and a child's dreams.
