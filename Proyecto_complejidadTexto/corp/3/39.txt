Along South Africa's east coast, sardines started their migration, which lasts from April to July in different locations around the coast. People call it the 'sardine run,' and the large shoal of fish is five to seven kilometres in length. Dolphins and predators see the sardine run as a feast, while scientists see the event as a time to research the animals. They learned that reproducing adults and juvenile fish are part of the sardine run.
