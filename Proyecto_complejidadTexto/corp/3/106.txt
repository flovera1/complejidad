A US congressman named Hakeem Jeffries wanted to pay tribute to New York rapper Biggie Smalls on the 20th anniversary of the rapper's death. Jeffries felt proud of the fact that he represents the district where the rapper lived. He rapped as he said that the rapper's  rags to riches  story is the 'classic embodiment of the American Dream' and though he is gone, he will never be forgotten. After the tribute, another congressman announced that the politicians would move from the topic of the Notorious B.I.G. 's music to the  notorious healthcare proposal'.
