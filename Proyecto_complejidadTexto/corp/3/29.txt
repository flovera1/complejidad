An ultrasonic keyboard was designed specifically for a cat's sense of hearing and plays music in feline frequencies, so not only can the keyboard player play in human frequencies, but your cat can also enjoy them. An enthusiastic team of vets, sound artists and scientists created the keyboard. It is fed through an iPad which converts the frequencies that people can hear into frequencies that only cats can hear. The team also created the keyboard as part of an anti-Internet censorship campaign called the Pussy Cat Riot. The first live show was a protest performance to an audience of cats playing national anthems of countries that heavily censor the Internet.
