Hikaru Cho, a Chinese national living in Japan made some surreal stop-motion films, and their inspiration came from a strange place. She said that she was at home and wanted to painted something, but did not know what to paint on. Then she thought to paint an eye onto her hand. She felt that it looked freaky, so she took a picture of it and found that it shocked others more than she expected. She added that people tend to judge people based on appearances, and she thinks that it is stupid. She wants her to work to show that all is not what it seems on the surface. Hikaru's social conscience is clear, and both Amnesty International and lucrative advertising deals are interested in her work.
