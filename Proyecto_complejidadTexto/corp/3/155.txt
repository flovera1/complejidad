A 5.5-magnitude quake hit a south eastern town in Turkey in the Adiyaman Province on Thursday, damaging buildings and injuring five with more people likely to follow. Four teams of 35 rescuers were sent to the area where four more tremors followed the main earthquake. Earthquakes are frequent in Turkey because the country lies on active fault lines, but the US Geological Survey said that the recent earthquake was very shallow, at only around 9 kilometres deep.
