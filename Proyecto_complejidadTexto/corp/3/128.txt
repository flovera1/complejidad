People recently found an ancient statue in Egypt. It is so big that they had to move it at night to avoid the traffic. The three-ton torso is probably one of the most famous pharaohs in Egypt. Historians think that it is a statue of Ramses II, who ruled Egypt for 60 years over 3000 years ago. Historians will assemble the statue's parts and restore them at the Egyptian museum in Cairo. An Egyptian-German archaeological team discovered the statue.
