People found a baby otter alone and struggling to survive in a canal in Arizona. Luckily, utility workers spotted and rescued it. When they took it to a wildlife centre, it was dehydrated, hungry and infested with fleas, but it was not long before its health recovered. The people there fed it cat's milk and mashed trout. The pup will now start a new life in one of the state's wildlife parks.
