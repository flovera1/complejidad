Services provided at a beauty centre for cats and dogs in Russia are similar to those that you get at health spas for humans. Owners bring their pets to the centre to spoil them with a massage or to get them in shape by doing doggy aqua aerobics, walking on a treadmill, or fit ball exercises with a personal coach. A dog owner explained that if you get a dog, you have to care for it, keep it in shape, bathe it, and feed it properly. This has become much easier with the help of the beauty centre. Groomers say that the most popular items are haircuts, fur masks and pedicures. The whole set costs around 20 US dollars, which is the amount that will also buy you an hour with a personal trainer.
