After gorging himself on junk food left behind by tourists, a morbidly obese wild monkey called 'Uncle Fat' has been placed on a strict diet. He has been limited to lean protein, fruit and vegetables. The zoo's veterinary physician said that the mass of fat became a type of benign tumour possibly also causing diabetes, vascular disease and eventually heart diseases. At the current 26 kilograms, the monkey is three times the average weight for his species.
