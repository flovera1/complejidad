Tourists and scientists from Italy's Volcanology Institute were observing Mount Etna, an active volcano in Italy, when it fired back. The flow of lava hit some snow and the contrast between cold and hot generated an explosion. At least 10 people were injured with six being hospitalised mostly with head injuries. Lava and ash spewing from Mount Etna provided a spectacle last week.
