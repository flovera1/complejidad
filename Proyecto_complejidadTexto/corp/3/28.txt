Someone captured on camera the moment that a helicopter crashed into the water near a superyacht in a Norwegian harbour. Three British citizens onboard were injured. The United Kingdom Foreign Office said that the crash occurred after a botched landing on the yacht. People suggested that the accident happened when a tarpaulin got stuck in the helicopter's rotors. British safety investigators are assisting their Norwegian counterparts.
