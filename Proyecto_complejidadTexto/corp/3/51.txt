The first Chinese-built passenger jet, C919, designed to compete with the Airbus 320 and the Boeing 737, took to the skies on its maiden flight. The plane took off from Shanghai's Pudong International Airport for an 80-minute flight. The Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) made the jet, and the state media described the plane's debut as 'another fulfilment of a Chinese dream.'
