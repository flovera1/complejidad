Teams from around the world gathered in a field in Hammamet in Tunisia to take part in the balloon festival with events taking place in Tunis and Sousse, as well. The event has grown since it was first launched three years ago with 25 balloons and up to 90 participants taking part. A pilot who has flow in a variety of countries including the USA, Iran, Spain and Latvia explained that you can technically land anywhere, but it is not always ease to come to the balloon by car to collect it, so landing in the desert is something new to him. A Lithuanian balloon crew member called ballooning the safest of all air transportation because there is almost no danger.
