A cat named Alley catapulted herself to the longest jump of 1.8 metres by a cat. This impressed the Guinness World Record adjudicators, who gave her the record. Alley is a rescue cat who people found in an alleyway in Chicago with three other cats. Early on, owner and trainer Samantha Martin realised that the furry feline had a special talent. She said that Alley started out as a frail cat and she has grown up to be strong and even a recording-holding cat. She quickly learned to jump from 0.6 metres to 1.8 metres right before she turned one year old. Alley is so good that she was the star of Samantha's Amazing Acro-Cats show, which tours around the United States.
