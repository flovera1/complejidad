A military lover who bought a tank on the internet for 30,000 found 2 million in gold inside. First, he and his mechanic were restoring the tank. They were afraid that there were guns inside the fuel tank. When they opened it, they found gold bars. The man called the police. The police took the bars away for investigation and gave him a receipt. People think that the gold was probably stolen by Iraqi soldiers when they invaded Kuwait in 1990.
