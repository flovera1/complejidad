Abraham Poincheval, an artist who specialises in endurance -testing performances, spent a whole week inside a boulder in an art gallery in Paris. People supplied him with water, soup and dried meat during his stunt. The 12-ton limestone had a body-shaped hole inside, large enough for a person to sit in. Air entered through holes. Poincheval said that the most complicated thing was to keep himself away from a world of hallucinations. For his previous performance, he spent 13 days inside a hollowed-out bear, and he is planning on sitting on eggs in an attempt to hatch them.
