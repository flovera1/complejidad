Siberian tiger cubs, twin girls Mao Mao and Ying Ying, and their older brother Shua Shuai, are being raised by a step dog mum after their own tiger mum resisted feeding them. The cubs are having a great time with their new step family, and they have been playing loads with their canine step brothers and sisters. The cuties have become stars at the Hangzhou Safari Park in east China's Zhejiang Province, but it won't be all fun and games forever, as the cubs are expected to be reunited with their parents soon.
