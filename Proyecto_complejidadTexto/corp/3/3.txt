A man was crossing the street in eastern China when two cars entered the crossroads from different sides. They swerved to avoid a collision but bumped into each other instead, as they sped towards the unsuspecting pedestrian. Luckily, he was able to react quickly and leapt out of harm's way, escaping death. While both vehicles had heavy damage, no one was injured.
