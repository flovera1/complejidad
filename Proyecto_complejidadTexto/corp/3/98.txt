In a beautiful, remote part of Mexico, a huge crocodile gave a swimmer the shock of his life when it chased him to shore. He frantically tried to reach the beach while the massive animal stalked him. Above on Boca Panila Bridge, panicked tourists watched in horror as the man made a beeline for dry land. A quick-thinking onlooker threw a big object in the water that stopped the snapper in his tracks. People think that a man named Manuel Carrea may have filmed this and he hoped that the footage would advise tourists not to feed the local wildlife. They certainly might think twice about it now!
