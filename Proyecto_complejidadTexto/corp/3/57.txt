A one-year-old baby climbed aboard a bus on his own in Central China. Neither the passengers or the bus driver could see if an adult taking care of the toddler, and the bus driver pulled over and called police for help. Passengers volunteered to take care of the baby until the police got there. Officers managed to track down his parents an hour later with the mother saying that her little boy was playing outside her cell phone store when she realised that he had gone off somewhere.
