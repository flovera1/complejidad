The Slow Mo Guys, in the real world known as Daniel Gruchy and Gavin Free, already have a bit of an online reputation, but their latest sensation is an explosion of a melon, and it has already gone viral. They used a large firecracker to blow up the fruit as one of them sat close by only to be covered in its juice and pulp. They used a high-speed camera that films at 25,000 frames per second, so the footage first shows a bright flash of orange light before the melon bursts into several pieces. The pair has been filming various things in slow motion, from water balloon fights to golf shots, and posting them on YouTube for the past 6 years.
