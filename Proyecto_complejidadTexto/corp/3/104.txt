Florida police charged 21-year-old Kieran Thomas because he blocked a road while he sat in a chair at a table and ate pancakes. Police knew that he did this because he posted a video of it on Facebook. The formal charge was obstruction of the road and disruption of traffic. Although police did not arrest the prankster, they asked him to appear in court over his crepes.
