In Belgium, there is a special flower in a botanic garden that is famous for its foul smell. It does not stop visitors from sticking their noses into it. The flower rarely blooms outside of its natural habitat in Indonesia, and it can take between three and ten years for it to mature. The flower smells like rotten meat to attract insect to pollinate it. Its stinky red leaves stay open only for two days.
