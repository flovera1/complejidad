People can see minke and humpback whales in an amazing new way with an ingenious filming technique: researchers attached cameras onto the whales. By using suction cups, the researchers attached digital tags to the whales' backs, and the digital tags have sensors and a camera. The researchers hope that the tags will bring information on the whales' feeding areas in Antarctica and bring them more protection, as well as give a rare glimpse into their world.
