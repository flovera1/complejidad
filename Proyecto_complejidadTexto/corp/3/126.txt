In North London and near a synagogue, someone put up a road sign to warn people about the presence of Jews. A Jewish community group reported the sign to the police and said that it was anti- Semitic. The rabbi said that the consequences of the sign were that it  traumatised people' and reminded them 'of some of the darkest periods in recent Jewish history'. Then people found out that the sign was supposed to be provocative but not anti-Semitic; it was part of an art project by a French artist named Franck Allais, who had placed 27 signs showing silhouetted figured around London. The artist apologised and explained that he thought that the red triangles on his signs had no 'bad' meanings. Nevertheless, a local council removed the offensive sign from the Jewish neighbourhood.
