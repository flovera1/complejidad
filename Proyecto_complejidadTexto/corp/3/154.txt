The Geneva Motor Show opened to the public today on Thursday 9th and runs through to March 19th. Tim Pollard, the digital editor-in-chief for Car Magazine, said that it was a very confident Geneva Motor Show with a lot of premium brands rolling out new cars like the Range Rover Velar. There are many performance and environmentally-friendly cars, as well. Renault is going to unveil an electric car that is actually also a sports car. The UK market is currently hitting record levels and experts say that more and more premium cars are being sold.
