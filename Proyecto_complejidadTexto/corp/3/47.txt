A 16-year-old Muslim girl has become the first person in America ever to wear a hijab during a competitive boxing match. She ended up losing the match but later said that it was about much more. She felt that she had a purpose in fighting for what she believes  that all girls should have a chance. She now has her sights on changing the international rules as well, so that she can compete at the Olympics in 2020 in her chosen attire. The teenager hopes that others will be inspired by her story and keep fighting for what they believe in.
