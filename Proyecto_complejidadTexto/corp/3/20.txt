A Maine Coon cat from Melbourne named Omar is possibly the longest domestic cat in the world. His owners were expecting him to be 9 kilograms big, but he reached this weight before the age of one year. He is now about 14 kilograms and 120 centimetres long. The owner said that Omar will remain just a house cat despite the current attention.
