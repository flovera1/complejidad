A group of little lion cubs passed their swimming test, as their keepers introduced them to water at a zoo in Washington. Lions and tigers at the zoo must pass the test to demonstrate their maturity. The keepers t ossed the cubs into a moat at the National Zoo and although irritated by the unexpected dunk, they all managed to swim safely to the side. All of the four 10-week-old cats held their heads above water, and three paddled to the shallow end and climbed on to dry land. A little one took a short cut instead, scampering out the same way that he entered.
