An Australian Shepherd dog named Blakely is a part-time nanny to three Malaysian tiger cubs at the Cincinnati Zoo in the USA. They can be seen climbing and pawing all over him. The cubs were born on February 3rd, and staff took over care when their mother ignored them. Blakeley is a resident companion to animals that need cuddling and comfort. The six-year-old dog gives the cubs a warm, furry body to climb on. He also keeps the cubs in check if they get too rough with their play. Blakely has been brought in before for surrogate duties  he has helped take care of baby cheetahs, wallabies, skunks and others. He is a 21 st century male!
