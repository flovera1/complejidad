A boy named Emre was ill and doctors were baffled by his symptoms, so they diagnosed him with a migraine and sent him home. His mother said that something was wrong because her son was having behaviour changes such as being angry, having rages, and vomiting. Emre drew a picture of the pain in his head on his Etch-A-Sketch and described it as a 'lump' in his head. His mother took a picture of his drawing and brought it to the doctors to highlight her concerns again. Doctors did a brain scan and found that Emre had a life-threatening brain tumour. They performed surgery and he is now recovering at home.
