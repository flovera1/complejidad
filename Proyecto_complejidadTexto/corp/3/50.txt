Four years ago, dogs attacked a goat named Billy and he almost died. While he recovered on a farm, a rooster named Samoa befriended him. The farm owner believes that Samoa visited the elderly goat because the other roosters had been fighting with him. Billy's rehabilitation took weeks and Samoa stayed with him the entire time. A farm worker explained that the rooster protected the goat from everything, even from people trying to help him. She believes that Samoa helped Billy heal because Billy had 'friendship the whole time'. She added that now Samoa goes everywhere that Billy goes, including sleeping with him and riding on him. These funny farm-yard friends are now inseparable.
