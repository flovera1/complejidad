A 7-metre python from the Chester Zoo had to go to the doctor's office to get an ultrasound heart scan. JF the python had her annual check-up with ten zoo staff who had to carry her to the vet. While the vet performed the scan, people covered her eyes to calm her down. The cardiac ultrasound will tell the zookeepers about the snake's point of view and the health of the heart and the heart muscle. The cardio -experts tried this on giraffes and sharks, but snake hearts are interesting, as they have three chambers. Human hearts have four chambers.
