King Salman, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, visited Indonesia, being the first Saudi ruler to visit the country in over 50 years. People said that he brought over 500 tons of stuff with him, which is the equivalent of 200 African elephants, during the nine-day trip. The king descended from his plane on one of his two elevators. He famously took the plane on a holiday in France and closed down an entire beach. An entourage of over 600 people, 800 delegates, 25 princes, a few Mercedes-Benz cars, and plenty of gilded furniture travelled with the king.
