The Jerusalem Nano Bible company developed a chip smaller than 5 by 5 millimetres. which manages to contain the original Greek version of the New Testament, making it the smallest Bible in the world. The tiny square chip can be embedded inside of watches and into pendants with infinite possibilities in the jewellery industry. The company's aim is to be able to mass produce it and put it into every pocket. The company plans on producing a nano-sized Old Testament, as well. An academic scholar validated the product and confirmed the Greek text on the chip was indeed that of the 27 books of the New Testament.
