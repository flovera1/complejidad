In Italy, a boat owner in the port of Rimini found a suitcase floating in the water and picked it up. He said that it was heavy and thought that it was full of clothing. Before he called the police, he unzipped the zipper to see what was inside and found a black bag in the shape of a person. He said that a bad smell came out, as well. Italian forensic police are trying to determine if the body is of Xing Lei Li who disappeared from a cruise in February. In Rome, police arrested her husband, Daniel Belling, in connection with her disappearance. His solicitor says that the body is too tall to be Xing's body, but investigators are keeping their minds open.
