A spate of accidents caused by black ice last autumn inspired a tournament in Russia. It was the country's first-ever car curling tournament. Four teams of 10 pushed tiny cars towards a target painted on an ice rink. Each team had nine attempts to get its three cars as close to the centre as possible. People removed the heaviest parts of the cars, including their engines and gearboxes, before the event.
