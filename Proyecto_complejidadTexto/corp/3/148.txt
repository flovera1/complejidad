Hundreds of widows have been celebrating Holi, the Indian festival of colour in the northrn Indian holy city of Vrindavan, which is known as the City of Widows because of the number of women who find shelter there. The widowed women danced with tourists who had come to see the festival. An Indian sociologist, Bindeshwar Pathak, started organising the celebrations for widows in 2013. Meera Chatri, a resident of a care home for the elderly, said they were not widows any more, as their lives have been elevated so much by Bindeshwar Pathak. They do not live like widows any more, as so much colour has come into their lives.
