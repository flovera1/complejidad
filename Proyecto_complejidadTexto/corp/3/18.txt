A rare celestial phenomenon appeared in Mongolia, and it looked like there were three suns in the sky. The middle sun was the one we usually see every day, but the ones on either side were the sun's smaller reflections. A local meteorological centre explained that the optical phenomenon is known as an anthelion, which means that the reflection is caused by sunshine high in the sky and light passing through snow crystals in the air. An anthelion can appear when the temperature is lower than -30, and the air is filled with clouds, vapour and ice crystals.
