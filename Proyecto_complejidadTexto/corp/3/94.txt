In Minnesota, USA, the bride groom and the whole wedding party took the plunge into a lake at a wedding. A video caught the moment that Dan and Jackie Anderson were dunked into a lake. They had just lined up on a dock with their groomsmen and bridesmaids for a photo shoot. This was before their wedding began. The weight of the 22 people was too heavy, and the dock collapsed beneath them, which resulted in the whole wedding party getting soaked. Screams and laughter echoed around the lake, and some of the bridesmaids were able to dash off. The rest of the group was in waist-deep water. The bride, groom and the whole wedding party were still drying off while the guests arrived for the wedding.
