'Keeping Up with the Kattasians' is an Icelandic reality show that follows the lives of some kittens. The set is a large doll house with many cameras so viewers can follow the 'cat-athleticism' for many hours a day. The Icelandic Cat Protection Society helped create the show. The idea is that four rescue kittens move into the house for 3 to 4 weeks at a time, and so far, the show has been a 'pawsitive' success. Many of the kittens have been re-homed and as each one is adopted, another homeless kitten takes its place.
