To celebrate Easter, a 140-kilogramme chocolate Thomas the Tank Engine arrived at King's Cross Station in London. Master chocolatiers created the giant sculpture, and it took them 250 hours to craft the exact replica of the blue engine. Thomas delighted children and adults when they saw him. A  Fat Controller  also came to give out chocolate eggs to everyone.
