Thousands of Mexicans have been visiting the pyramids of Teotihuacan, located 40 kilometres outside of Mexico City. They are celebrating the spring equinox, hoping to receiving new energy for the rest of the year. A visiting teacher said that the people were asking for peace and harmony of the spirit with the universe because people are part of it and cannot destroy it. Many people climbed the Pyramid of the Sun to receive its energy and wore white clothing, as they believed that it would help them receive positive energy from the sun.
