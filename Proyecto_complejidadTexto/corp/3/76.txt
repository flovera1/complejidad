In Colombo, Sri Lanka, a massive mound of rubbish sat next to a poor neighbourhood called Meetotamulla. The residents, who lived in tiny homes, protested against the health hazards of the situation, but then the worst happened. The garbage collapsed onto the homes, killing 17 people and injuring 13 more. Soldiers were looking for any other people that might be trapped under the rubble. Over 600 people had to flee their neighbourhood. One man said that when they would protest to the police about the trash dumping, those police would beat and arrest them. He asked that though those same police were there to help in rescues, what could they do now?
