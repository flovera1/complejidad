A skydiver in Norway released footage he filmed back in 2012 of what he believes to be a meteorite. Anders Helstrup has spent the past two years trying to find out what the mysterious black object was that sped past him that day. The footage shows what looks like a large rock hurtling by at high speed, as he was skydiving over Hedmark in southern Norway. He insists that there was nothing above him at the time and believes that it was a meteorite, despite criticism from scientists. Most meteorites burn when they enter Earth's atmosphere but some survive and are extinguished only 20 kilometres above Earth. Together with Norway's Space and Meteorite Centre, Anders is trying to piece together where the UFO might have landed.
