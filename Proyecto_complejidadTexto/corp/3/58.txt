The birth of last killer whale living in captivity has been captured on video. The calf was born to 25-year-old Takara in a Sea World park in Texas. Sea World announced the end of its orca breeding programme last year. It was after the film 'Blackfish' which raised concerns about welfare of orcas living in captivity. Animal rights campaigners want to move both orcas into a wildlife reservation.
